# Nexus: Blockchain ETL Tool

Nexus is a versatile blockchain ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tool integrated into the Block Forge monorepo. It facilitates the transfer of data between different blockchain networks by extracting data from source blockchains, performing necessary transformations, and loading the data into target blockchains. Nexus is built using Go and leverages an event-based architecture, plugin-based architecture, and orchestration framework for flexibility, extensibility, and manageability.

## Overview

Nexus, serves as a powerful blockchain ETL tool within the Block Forge monorepo. It facilitates the extraction of data from source blockchain networks, performs necessary transformations, and loads the data into target blockchain networks. Nexus is designed to handle diverse blockchain data transfer needs efficiently.

## Components

### Blockchain Adapters

Nexus includes blockchain-specific adapters responsible for extracting data from source blockchain networks. These adapters, communicate with the source blockchain's APIs to fetch data such as transactions, blocks, and smart contract events. Each adapter publishes events to the event bus to notify other components of new data availability.

### Transformation Pipeline

Extracted data flows through a transformation pipeline consisting of multiple stages. The pipeline, composed of modular components implemented as plugins, allows flexible and customizable data transformations. Each pipeline stage subscribes to relevant events on the event bus and processes data asynchronously.

### Blockchain Relays

Processed data is forwarded to blockchain-specific relays responsible for loading the data into the target blockchain networks. Relays, implemented as plugins, interact with the target blockchain's APIs to submit transactions, deploy smart contracts, or update on-chain data. Each relay subscribes to events on the event bus to receive data for loading into the target blockchain.

### Event Bus

Nexus utilizes an event bus to facilitate communication between loosely coupled components. Components publish events to the event bus to notify others of changes or new data availability. Subscribers listen for specific events and react accordingly, enabling decoupled and asynchronous communication.

### Plugin System

Nexus features a plugin-based architecture allowing dynamic loading and unloading of functionality. New adapters, pipelines, relays, and event handlers can be added via plugins without modifying the core codebase. Plugins are dynamically discovered and loaded at runtime, providing flexibility and extensibility for customization.

### Orchestration Framework

Nexus incorporates an orchestration framework responsible for coordinating and executing ETL processes. The framework interprets ETL configurations defined by users and coordinates the execution of adapters, pipelines, and relays accordingly. It handles task scheduling, dependency resolution, error handling, and monitoring of ETL processes.

### Task Scheduler

Nexus integrates a task scheduler component to enable the scheduling of ETL processes at predefined intervals or specified triggers. The task scheduler invokes the orchestration framework to execute scheduled tasks based on defined schedules and configurations.

### Monitoring and Logging

The system includes monitoring and logging capabilities to track the progress and performance of ETL processes. Monitoring tools provide real-time insights into the status of adapters, pipelines, and relays, allowing proactive management and troubleshooting.

## Key Features

- **Event-Based Architecture**: Nexus employs an event-based architecture for asynchronous and decoupled data processing.
- **Plugin-Based Architecture**: The plugin-based architecture allows dynamic addition of new functionality without modifying the core codebase.
- **Orchestration Framework**: Nexus provides a formal mechanism for orchestrating and managing ETL processes, enabling task scheduling, dependency resolution, and monitoring.
- **Modular Design**: Nexus is designed with modularity in mind, promoting code reuse, maintainability, and scalability.
- **Scalability**: Nexus enables horizontal scalability to handle increasing volumes of data and workload efficiently.

## Use Cases

- **Blockchain Migration**: Nexus facilitates seamless data migration between different blockchain networks.
- **Cross-Chain Integration**: The tool synchronizes data between multiple blockchain networks, customizable via plugins.
- **Blockchain Analytics**: Nexus enables blockchain analytics and data analysis by extracting, transforming, and loading blockchain data into analytics platforms or databases.
- **Blockchain Development**: Developers leverage Nexus for blockchain development workflows, such as testing and deploying smart contracts across different blockchain networks.

## Getting Started

This section provides instructions for setting up and running Nexus on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) version 1.16 or later
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for cloning the repository

### Installation

1. Clone the Block Forge monorepo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/blockforge/monorepo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the `nexus` directory:

   ```bash
   cd monorepo/nexus
   ```

3. Build the Nexus binary:

   ```bash
   go build
   ```

### Configuration

Nexus requires a configuration file to specify the desired adapters, pipelines, relays, and other settings. Refer to the [Configuration Guide](docs/configuration.md) for detailed instructions on setting up your configuration.

### Running Nexus

After building the binary and configuring Nexus, you can run it with the following command:

```bash
./nexus --config /path/to/your/config.yaml
```

Replace `/path/to/your/config.yaml` with the actual path to your configuration file.
