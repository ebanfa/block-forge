## Introduction
BitScale is a blockchain settlement and data availability service. The system combines decentralized components, leveraging the Cosmos SDK, with centralized services to provide a robust and scalable solution.
## Staking and Validators
The BitScale network relies on a staking mechanism to ensure the security and reliability of the settlement and data availability services. Validator nodes, which are responsible for processing transactions, maintaining the blockchain data, and participating in the POS consensus protocol, must stake the native BitScale tokens to become validators. The staked tokens act as a bond or security deposit, incentivizing the validators to act honestly and in the best interest of the network. The staking mechanism helps to secure the BitScale network by aligning the incentives of the validators with the overall health and stability of the system.

## Operators and Validators
The BitScale network has two main types of participants:

1. **Operators**: These are the blockchain networks that integrate with the BitScale services and utilize the settlement and data availability capabilities. Operators submit transactions, query data, and interact with the BitScale system through the provided APIs.

2. **Validators**: The validators are the nodes that make up the BitScale network. They are responsible for validating transactions, maintaining the blockchain data, and participating in the POS consensus process. Validators are incentivized through the staking mechanism, where they stake the native BitScale tokens to become a validator and earn rewards for their participation in the network.

The operators (client blockchain networks) do not directly participate in the validation and consensus process. Instead, they rely on the BitScale validators to process their transactions and maintain the data availability for their blockchains.

This separation of operators and validators, combined with the staking mechanism, helps to ensure the security, reliability, and decentralization of the BitScale ecosystem.

## Decentralized Components

### Cosmos Modules

#### Settlement Module
- **Specification**: The Settlement Module is responsible for coordinating transaction finalization and settlement within the Bitscale ecosystem. It leverages the built-in consensus mechanism provided by the Cosmos SDK to ensure the integrity and finality of transactions.
- **Features**:
  - Transaction finalization using the Cosmos consensus protocol.
  - Transaction processing logic to update account balances and maintain the global state.
  - Integration with other Cosmos modules, such as the Interoperability Module, to enable cross-chain settlement.
  - Handling of chain reorganizations and providing finality guarantees for transactions.

#### Data Availability Module
- **Specification**: The Data Availability Module ensures the availability and integrity of blockchain data within the Bitscale ecosystem.
- **Features**:
  - Cryptographic verification of data integrity using techniques like Merkle proofs.
  - Monitoring and alerting for data availability issues, enabling rapid detection and resolution.
  - Provision of data availability proofs to clients, allowing them to verify the integrity of the stored data.

#### Staking Module
- **Specification**: The Staking Module facilitates the depositing and withdrawing of native BitScale tokens for staking purposes. It manages the staked tokens, tracks the staking balance of validators and delegators, and enforces the staking rules defined by the network.
- **Features**:
  - Deposit: Allows users to deposit native BitScale tokens into the staking pool to participate in the consensus protocol as either validators or delegators.
  - Withdrawal: Enables users to withdraw their staked tokens from the staking pool, subject to certain conditions (e.g., unbonding period).
  - Staking Pool Management: Tracks the total staked tokens in the network and manages the distribution of rewards to validators and delegators based on their staked balance.
  - Staking Rewards Calculation: Calculates and distributes rewards to validators and delegators based on their participation in the consensus protocol.

#### Delegation Module
- **Specification**: The Delegation Module enables users to delegate their staked tokens to validators. Delegation allows validators to increase their staked balance and potential rewards, while delegators benefit from passive income without actively participating in validation.
- **Features**:
  - Delegate: Users can delegate a portion of their staked tokens to validators to increase their staked balance and potential rewards.
  - Undelegate (Exit): Users can initiate an undelegation process to withdraw their delegated tokens from the validator's stake, subject to the unbonding period.
  - Delegation Rewards: Calculates and distributes rewards to validators and delegators based on their delegated stake and participation in the consensus protocol.

#### Slashing Module
- **Specification**: The Slashing Module enforces penalties against validators for malicious behavior or protocol violations. Slashing mechanisms are designed to disincentivize dishonest behavior and maintain the integrity and security of the network.
- **Features**:
  - Slashing Conditions: Defines the conditions under which validators may be subject to slashing, such as double signing, unavailability, or equivocation.
  - Slashing Enforcement: Detects and penalizes validators found in violation of the slashing conditions by confiscating a portion of their staked tokens.
  - Slashing Severity: Determines the severity of slashing penalties based on the severity of the violation and the potential impact on the network's security and reliability.

#### Interoperability Module
- **Specification**: The Interoperability Module facilitates communication between different blockchain networks within the Cosmos ecosystem. It implements the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol to enable coordination.
- **Features**:
  - Implementation of the IBC protocol, supporting various message types and relayer mechanisms.
  - Cross-chain transaction validation and coordination, ensuring atomic execution of cross-chain operations.
  - Integration with the Settlement Module for seamless cross-chain asset settlement.

#### Cosmos Mempool
- **Specification**: The Cosmos Mempool module manages the pool of pending transactions before they are included in blocks. It aligns with the built-in mempool functionality of the Cosmos SDK and provides additional customizations and enhancements for efficient transaction processing.
- **Features**:
  - Transaction mempool management, including validation, ordering, and prioritization.
  - Transaction prioritization based on gas fees and network congestion.
  - Integration with the Settlement Module and consensus mechanisms for transaction finalization.
  - Customizations and optimizations to improve the mempool's performance and scalability.
