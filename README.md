## Overview

BlockForge is designed to foster the development of cutting-edge blockchain solutions, ranging from data relays and blockchain building tools to decentralized bridges, business process management systems, and ZK Rollup chains. By consolidating multiple projects into a single repository, we aim to promote code sharing, consistent dependency management, and a unified development experience.

## Projects

The following projects are currently hosted within the BlockForge monorepo:

- **BlockETL**: An advanced data relay for blockchains, acting as an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tool for blockchain data.
- **Nova**: A blockchain building application that enables rapid scaffolding of Cosmos SDK-based blockchains.

Additional projects, such as a decentralized bridge, a decentralized business process management blockchain, and a ZK Rollup chain, are planned for future development within the monorepo.

## Getting Started

To get started with BlockForge, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Go installed on your machine. You can download it from the official [Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).

2. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/blockforge.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the monorepo directory**:

   ```bash
   cd blockforge
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

5. **Build and run a project**:

   ```bash
   # Build and run BlockETL
   go build -o blocketl ./blocketl/cmd
   ./blocketl

   # Build and run BuildNet
   go build -o nova ./nova/cmd
   ./nova
   ```

For more detailed instructions on building, testing, and running specific projects, refer to the respective project's documentation within the monorepo.
