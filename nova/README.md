# Nova: A Modular Blockchain Framework Scaffolding and Configuration Management Application

Nova is an application designed to streamline the development of modular blockchain applications. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and features for scaffolding, configuring, and generating code for blockchain frameworks that follow a modular architecture.

## Overview

Nova empowers developers to define and manage the configuration of various components and modules that make up their blockchain application, such as transactions, queries, state structures, and dependencies. With Nova, you can:

- Define and configure the core components of your blockchain application through a user-friendly command-line interface or graphical user interface.
- Leverage a modular and composable approach to building blockchain applications, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
- Validate and visualize your application's configuration, ensuring consistency and correctness before code generation.
- Generate boilerplate code, data structures, and artifacts specific to your target blockchain platform or framework, automating the scaffolding process.
- Support for multiple blockchain platforms and frameworks, including Cosmos SDK, Ethereum (as smart contracts), Substrate, and more.

## Features

- **Modular Configuration Management**: Define and manage the configuration of modules, transactions, queries, state structures, and dependencies through a structured and hierarchical approach.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Interact with Nova through a powerful and intuitive command-line interface, enabling efficient configuration management and code generation.
- **Dependency Graph**: Visualize and manage dependencies between different components of your blockchain application using a dependency graph.
- **Configuration Validation**: Ensure the correctness and consistency of your application's configuration through built-in validation rules and checks.
- **Code Generation**: Generate boilerplate code, data structures, and artifacts specific to your target blockchain platform or framework, accelerating the development process.
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Target multiple blockchain platforms and frameworks, including Cosmos SDK, Ethereum (as smart contracts), Substrate, and more, without modifying the core logical model.
- **Extensibility**: Nova is designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of new code generators and support for emerging blockchain platforms or frameworks.

## Getting Started

1. Install Nova by following the instructions in the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/nova/nova/blob/main/docs/installation.md).
2. Initialize a new blockchain project with `nova init my-project`.
3. Define and configure your application using Nova's command-line interface or graphical user interface.
4. Generate code and artifacts for your target blockchain platform or framework with `nova generate`.
5. Build and run your blockchain application using the generated code and artifacts.

## Example Usage

```bash
# Initialize a new blockchain project
nova init my-project

# Add a new module
nova config add module --name=token --parent=root

# Add a new transaction to the token module
nova config add transaction --name=transfer --parent=token --input-fields=sender,recipient,amount --handler=handleTransfer

# Add a new query to the token module
nova config add query --name=balance --parent=token --input-fields=address --response-field=balance

# Add a dependency between the token module and the governance module
nova config dependency add --dependency=governance --parent=token

# Validate the current configuration
nova config validate

# Visualize the configuration tree and dependency graph
nova config visualize --format=ascii

# Generate code and artifacts for the Cosmos SDK blockchain
nova generate --target=cosmos-sdk

# Build the blockchain application binary
nova build

# Run the blockchain application
nova run
```
